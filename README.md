My project utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to predict the likelihood of news articles being fake. By analyzing linguistic structures, sentiment, and contextual cues, it discerns patterns indicative of misinformation. Through extensive training on labeled datasets, the ML models learn to identify key features that distinguish genuine from fabricated news. This approach empowers users to make informed decisions about the credibility of the information they consume, contributing to the mitigation of misinformation spread. Ultimately, the project aims to bolster media literacy and promote a more discerning approach to news consumption in the digital age.
